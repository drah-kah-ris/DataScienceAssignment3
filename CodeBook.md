####Steps taken for transforming the training+test data:	
	1. Read the training file
	2. used features file as the column names for the training dataset 
	3. Filtered the mean() and std() columns
	4. Joined the activity_labels dataset with the activity dataset to get the activity names
	5. Created a new column(activity) in the training dataset using the above activity names
	6. crated a new column(subject) in the training dataset using the subjet file
	7. Repeat the above the steps for test file
	8. Merged the training and test dataset
	9. Computed the mean of all the mean and std columns grouped by subject and activity

####The following are column names of the "Subject_Activity_Average.txt" dataset. The columns are in order.
